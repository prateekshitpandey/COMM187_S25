Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon and **R**! On Jupyter, you can write code and execute its output right underneath it. More importantly, Jupyter can be hosted on a server, which means that the code runs on the server and not your computer. This is helpful for us, because we do not need to install anything on our computers, and we can simply write and execute Python code using Jupyter.\n",
