    " - Each member of the group must propose a hypothesis that they would like to explore. \n",
    " - Put all the hypotheses together, and construct one research question that connects all these hypotheses.\n",
    " - It is highly recommended that you discuss within your group what your individual hypotheses should be in order to make your research question as coherent as possible. Discuss with the instructors as needed.\n",
    " - For example, if a group of 4 are working on the [redlining dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data), and the following hypotheses are chosen by the group members:\n",
    "   - Hypothesis by member 1: The percentage of White population in HOLC Grade A areas are not associated with the percentage of white population in the surrounding areas.\n",
    "   - Hypothesis by member 2: The percentage of Hispanic population in HOLC Grade C areas are associated with the percentage of White population in that area.\n",
    "   - Hypothesis by member 3: The percentage of White population in HOLC Grade D areas are negatively associated with the percentage of Black population in that area.\n",
    "   - Hypothesis by member 4: The percentage of Asian population in HOLC Grade B areas are always lesser than the percentage of White population in the surrounding area.\n",
    " - Based on these hypotheses, one possible way to frame your research question could be:\\\n",
    "   ***What are the patterns of proportions of racial and ethnic group populations across HOLC Grades?***"
