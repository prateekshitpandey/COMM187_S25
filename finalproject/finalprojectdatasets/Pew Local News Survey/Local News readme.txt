PEW RESEARCH CENTER
LOCAL NEWS HABITS SURVEY
Dates: October 15-November 8, 2018
Mode: Web
Language: English and Spanish
N=34,897

******************************************************************************************
This is the survey dataset for the report, 'For Local News, Americans Embrace Digital but 
Still Want Strong Community Connection' and the accompanying online interactive tool.

The survey was conducted online in English and Spanish. It includes 10,654 respondents 
from Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel and 24,243 from Ipsos' KnowledgePanel. 

REPORT: https://www.journalism.org/2019/03/26/for-local-news-americans-embrace-digital-but-still-want-strong-community-connection/

INTERACTIVE: https://www.journalism.org/interactives/local-news-habits/

WEIGHTS

All national estimates in the report were calculated using the WEIGHT variable.

**** IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ESTIMATES FOR INDIVIDUAL CBSAS *****

For most CBSAs, there are not enough respondents in this dataset to permit reliable 
CBSA-level estimates using only the survey data and the weight variable. Survey estimates
for individual CBSAs in the report and the accompanying interactive were NOT produced 
using the WEIGHT variable but with a statistical modeling technique known as 
multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP), a method designed to calculate more 
precise estimates for small subgroups. 

*** AS A RESULT, ESTIMATES FOR INDIVIDUAL CBSAS COMPUTED USING THE WEIGHT VARIABLE WILL NOT 
MATCH THE ESTIMATES FOUND IN THE REPORT OR IN THE ONLINE INTERACTIVE. ***

For details on MRP and how CBSA-level estimates were computed for the the report and 
online interactive, see the Methodology section of the report:

NOTES

To protect respondent privacy, open-ended responses MAINSOURCE_LOC, and other-specify 
responses for PROVIDERi and LOCALGROUPSi have been removed from the data. 

Additionally, the variable LOCAL_AREA includes CBSA identifiers only for respondents 
who come from the 99 CBSAs that are reported individually in the online interactive. 
Respondents from the remaining CBSAs are grouped into six clusters made up of CBSAs that 
share similar characteristics. For details on how the clusters were created, see the 
Methodology section of the report:

https://www.journalism.org/2019/03/26/local-news-methodology/


A list of CBSAs belonging to each cluster along with their corresponding MRP estimates
