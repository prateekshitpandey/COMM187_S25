    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**Redlining**</span> is the discriminatory practice of denying services (like mortgages) to residents of certain areas based on racial or ethnic composition, leading to economic and social disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is stored as a csv file in the sub-folder \"data\" by the name \"metro-grades.csv\". \\\n",
    "You can read more about the dataset on its [github repository page](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/redlining). I have copied relevant information about the dataset below:\n",
    "\n",
    "This csv file contains 2020 population total estimates by race/ethnicity for combined zones of each redlining grade (from Home Owners' Loan Corporation \\[HOLC\\] maps originally drawn in 1935-40, downloaded from the [Mapping Inequality project](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/37.8/-97.9&maps=0)) within micro- and metropolitan areas. Also included are population estimates in the surrounding area of each metropolitan area's HOLC map (computed by adding a 10 percent buffer radius to the minimum bounding circle of all zones in that metro area) and [location quotients](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/technical-appendix#footnote34_cnxakh3) (LQs) for each racial/ethnic group and HOLC grade. LQs are small-area measures of segregation that specifically compare one racial/ethnic group’s proportion in a granular geography to their proportion in a larger surrounding geography. An LQ above 1 for a given racial group indicates overrepresentation in that HOLC zone relative to the broader surrounding area, and values below 1 indicate underrepresentation. Only micro- and metropolitan areas with both A- (“best”) and D-rated (“hazardous”) zones in their redlining map are included — 138 of a total 143 metropolitan areas in the data from Mapping Inequality.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **violin plot** combines a box plot with a kernel density plot on each side, creating a \"violin\" shape. Like box plots, they show median, quartiles, and range. **The key addition is the width of the violin at any point represents how common that value is in the data - wider sections mean more data points at that value.** This reveals the full distribution shape, showing whether data is bimodal (two peaks), skewed, or has other patterns that box plots hide. Particularly useful when comparing distributions across multiple groups side-by-side.\n",
