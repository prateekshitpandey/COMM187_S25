    "## Question 3: Analysis without high circulation newspapers\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that correlations observed thus far are skewed, or inflated, because of the high circulation newspapers. High circulation newspapers are typically well resourced, and employ journalists who have high chances of winning the Pulitzer prize. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's conduct an analysis without the high circulation newspapers, and notice if the correlation changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**First step (A):** identify the newspapers for which the circulation is high, and make a new dataframe which excludes them.\\\n",
    "**Second step (B):** in this new dataset, calculate the correlation between the number of Pulitzer award winners and finalists (1990 - 2014) and change in circulation (2004 - 2013)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Removing high circulation newspapers (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, \"high circulation newspapers\" are defined as the ones for which the daily circulation in 2013 was higher than the mean + standard deviation of all circulations in 2013. (Can you think of a reason why we are choosing this definition of \"high circulation newspapers\"? Post your best guess in this week's Discussion Board.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify these newspapers, and make a new dataframe `df_filtered` which does not include these high circulation newspapers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    " - Calcualte the mean of \"Daily Circulation, 2013\" column using `.mean()` method and store it in a new variable `mean_circ_2013`\n",
    " - Calcualte the standard deviation of \"Daily Circulation, 2013\" column using `.std()` method and store it in a new variable `std_circ_2013`\n",
    " - Add the mean and standard deviation and store it in a new variable `mean_plus_std_2013`\n",
    " - Filter `df` to keep rows in which the value in \"Daily Circulation, 2013\" is less than or equal to `mean_plus_std_2013`, and store the result in a new variable `df_filtered` \\\n",
    "   Note: You have done a similar filtering in previous exercises, including Question 1 of Coding Assignment #4! You got this. Piece of cake."
